# Natural-scene-using-OpenGl
I used OpenGl and Glut libraries in C++, to draw a natural scene.
The scene consists of mountains, small boats, sea, sky and a big ship that moves in the right direction.
This project demonstrate the use of the primary graphical shapes like lines, polygons and triangles to draw a full scene.
